RunCmd
======

RunCmd is a simple windows batch file editor/commandline helper utility. We can create/edit batch files and test them using RunCmd.

RunCmd is basically a simplest MVVM implementation in WPF - using no external MVVM Frameworks - all homebrew basic utilities needed to implement MVVM Pattern in WPF.

RunCmd can also be a kickstart project for most simple MVVM implementation when we want only essentials inside our app with no external dependency.

The description of this project is yet to be created. This is a demo project and should not be used in production.
